<h3>Mg ion</h3>
<p>
A magnesium (Mg) ion is a required constituent of the catalytically
competent enzyme, and seems to be present in all physiologically
relevant forms of the protein. It is possible to substitute  <i>in
vitro</i> the Mg for certain other divalent metal ions, such as
manganese (Mn).
