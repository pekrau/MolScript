<h3>Effector loops</h3>
<p>
The two long loops closest to the Mg ion display the largest
conformational differences when comparing the GDP and GTP forms of ras
p21. These loops are also the most variable, as illustrated
in <a href="ras_rmsd.wrl" target="vrml">this VRML model</a>,
where the colours indicate variability (blue=well-defined,
red=variable). These loops are the main sites of interactions with
other proteins, such as SOS and rasGAP.
