<h1 align=center>Explicit values</h1>

Explicit values such as numbers, colours and 3D vectors are used as
part of commands or state changes. The specifications described here
are therefore just syntax fragments, not complete commands.

<h2><a name="logical">Logical specifications</a></h2>

<h3>on off</h3>

The logical (or boolean) explicit values are used to set some
parameters and in a few commands.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="string">String specifications</a></h2>

<h3>&quot; <i>string-contents</i> &quot;</h3>

String values are used in the <a href="commands.html#label">label</a>
command, the <a href="coordinates.html#read">read</a> command and a
few others. A string value is enclosed by double-quote '&quot;'
characters. It cannot contain the newline character (line breaks),
which means that a string cannot be split into more than one line in
the input file. The maximum length of a string is currently 2047
characters. The double-quote character '&quot;' itself may be included
in a string by escaping it with the backslash character: '\&quot;'.

<h3><i>identifier</i></h3>

As a special case, a string which contains no blank characters, such
as tabs or spaces, may be used without the double-quotes. This
kind of string is called an identifier. There are several restrictions
on it: there must be no blank characters in it, it must not contain
characters that are special in a MolScript input file (semi-colon ';',
curly brackets '{' '}'), and it cannot be equal to a command
keyword. Typically, file names are identifiers.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="number">Number specifications</a></h2>

Any item that is a valid numerical value for the standard library
routines in the C programming language is also a valid number in
MolScript. Some examples: 

<blockquote>
<code>
1.2
<br>
0.3e1
<br>
-1.44E1
<br>
-1000
</code>
</blockquote>

Some <strong>invalid</strong> numbers:
<blockquote>
<code>
.2
<br>
1E2
</code>
</blockquote>

<strong>Note</strong> that in contrast to previous versions of
MolScript (v1.4 and older), it is now allowed to give an integer value
when a floating-point value is expected. The integer is automatically
converted into a floating-point value. However, when an integer is
expected, a floating point value is invalid.

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="vector">Vector specifications</a></h2>

A vector (or coordinate) can be specified either by an explicit
triplet of numbers, or by the keyword <code>position</code> given with
an atom selection.
<p>
<br>

<h3>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
</h3>

A vector specified by explicit x, y and z values, is given by three
numbers <strong>without</strong> separating commas. The values in a
vector must be valid <a href="#number">numbers</a>. For example, the 
<a href="state.html#labeloffset">labeloffset</a> parameter is a vector
parameter, so to change it give the following command:

<blockquote>
<code>
set labeloffset 0 0.5 -0.8;
</code>
</blockquote>

<h3>position <a href="selection.html#atom"><i>atom-selection</i></a></h3>

A vector may be specified by giving an atom selection after the
keyword <code>position</code>. This will compute the geometrical
centre-of-gravity of the atoms as the vector value. All atoms in the
selection have the same weight. <strong>Note</strong> that in the 
<a href="coordinates.html#transform">transform</a> command, this
computation is done <strong>before</strong> any of the transformations
have been applied.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that the atom selection must contain at least
one atom, or an error will result.

<hr>
<h2><a name="colour">Colour specifications</a></h2>

Colours can be specified by a name, by greyscale, by the
RGB (red, green, blue) system, or by the HSB (hue, saturation,
brightness) system.
<p>
The colour system within MolScript unfortunately cannot 
guarantee that the appearance of a given colour specification will be
the same in different output formats when displayed on different
hardware.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="grey">grey</a> <a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<br>
gray  <a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
</h3>

The value in the greyscale specification ranges from 0.0 (black) to
1.0 (white), inclusive.

<h3>
<a name="rgb">rgb</a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
</h3>

The values in the RGB specification denote the amount of red, green
and blue, respectively, colour components to use in the colour. Each
value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive.

<h3>
<a name="hsb">hsb</a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
<a href="#number"><i>number</i></a>
</h3>

The values in the HSB specification denote the hue, saturation and
brightness values for a colour. These values must all be within the
range from 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive.
<ol>
<li>The hue is defined in a circular fashion from
0.0 = red, 0.2 = yellow, 0.333 = green, 0.667 = blue, 0.8 = violet,
1.0 = red again.
<li>The saturation can be described as the whiteness of
the colour, where 0.0 is completely white and 1.0 is full colour.
<li>The brightness (loosely, intensity) goes from 0.0 = black to 1.0 =
full intensity. 
</ol>

<h3><a name="colour_names">Colour names</a></h3>
There are a total of 164 colour names defined in MolScript. They are
just symbolic constants for ordinary colour specifications in the 
greyscale (white and black) or RGB systems (all others). 
<p align=center>
<strong>
<a href="colour_names.html">An alphabetical list of defined colour
names is given here
</strong>
</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: the colour purple is no longer the same as magenta.

<h2><a name="ramp">Colour ramp specifications</a></h2>

A colour ramp defines a continuously changing scale of colours. Colour
ramps are used for the 
<a href="state.html#atomcolour">atomcolour</a> and
<a href="state.html#residuecolour">residuecolour</a> parameters.
<p>
The ramp is defined by the two end-point colours. The actual result is
crucially dependent on the colour space in which the ramp is
defined. This is determined by the 
<a href="state.html#colourramp">colourramp</a> parameter.
The reason for this is that the ramp is computed by linear
interpolation of each colour component in the end-point
colours. When the interpolation is done using the red, green and blue 
components (<a href="#rgb">RGB</a>), the result will be different
compared to an interpolation using the hue, saturation, brightness
components (<a href="#hsb">HSB</a>) even though the two end-point
colours have the same visual appearance.
<p>
The <a href="#hsb">HSB</a> colour space is conceptually a
colour-wheel. It is therefore possible to interpolate in two opposite
directions in the HSB colour space. The
<a href="state.html#hsbreverseramp">hsbreverseramp</a> parameter
determines which direction is used. If the two end-point colours are
<code>hsb 0 1 1</code> (red) and <code>hsb 0.667 1
1</code> (blue), then interpolation with <code>hsbreverseramp
off</code> (the default) will be in the forward direction, and will go
through <code>hsb 0.333 1 1</code> (green). If the parameter is
<code>on</code>, then the interpolation will instead go through
<code>hsb 0.8 1 1</code> (purple).
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that it does not matter which colour space is
used in the specifications for the ramp end-point colours. The
interpolation is determined by the 
<a href="state.html#colourramp">colourramp</a> and 
<a href="state.html#hsbreverseramp">hsbreverseramp</a> parameters,
not by how the end-point colours are specified.

<h3>
from <a href="#colour"><i>colour-specification</i></a>
to <a href="#colour"><i>colour-specification</i></a>
</h3>

Defines the colour ramp by two explicit end-point colour
values. The lower end of the colour ramp is given by the first
colour. The interpolation calculation is affected by the
<a href="state.html#colourramp">colourramp</a> parameter, and if this
parameter is <code>hsb</code>, then the
<a href="state.html#hsbreverseramp">hsbreverseramp</a> parameter also
comes into play.

<h3>
rainbow
</h3>

This defines a colour ramp in the HSB colour space from blue to red
via cyan, green, and yellow, <i>i.e.</i> in the reverse direction.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that, currently, this colour ramp specification
will automatically set the
<a href="state.html#colourramp">colourramp</a> parameter to
<code>hsb</code> and the
<a href="state.html#hsbreverseramp">hsbreverseramp</a> parameter to
<code>on</code>. This is really a <a href="bugs.html#known">bug</a>.
