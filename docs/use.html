<h2><a name="running">Running MolScript</a></h2>

The MolScript executable (<strong>molscript</strong>) should be directly
available as a command, that is, it should be located in your path. To
test this, try the following command, which will just output all
command-line options available:

<blockquote><code>
% molscript -h
</code></blockquote>

If the program does not seem available, ask your system administrator or
whoever <a href="installation.html">installed</a> it.

<p>
To get a first input file, use the <a href="molauto.html">MolAuto
program</a>. This takes a coordinate file as input, and produces a
first-approximation input file for MolScript:

<blockquote><code>
% molauto pdb1crn.ent > input.file
</code></blockquote>

By default, MolScript reads the input file from the <strong>stdin</strong>
(standard input) and writes the result to <strong>stdout</strong>
(standard output), while execution messages and error messages are
output to <strong>stdout</strong> (standard output). For example, to
produce a <a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript</a> file, give
the command:

<blockquote><code>
% molscript -ps < input.file > output.ps
</code></blockquote>

<p>
The <a href="output.html#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL</a> mode produces
no output, so there is no need specify an output file: 

<blockquote><code>
% molscript -gl < input.file
</code></blockquote>

The best way to use the
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL</a> mode is to use an
explicitly named input file (using the <strong>-in</strong>
<a href="#options">command-line option</a>). This allows re-reading
the input file after the user has modified it with a text editor,
which speeds up preparation of input files. See the documentation on
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">the mouse button functions</a>. 

<blockquote><code>
% molscript -gl -in input.file
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Using UNIX pipes, one can get quick visualizations of a coordinate
file using <a href="molauto.html">MolAuto</a> and the
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL</a> mode:

<blockquote><code>
% molauto protein.pdb | molscript -gl
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, a VRML 2.0 file can be created quickly with MolAuto:

<blockquote><code>
% molauto protein.pdb | molscript -vrml
</code></blockquote>

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="options">Command-line options</a></h2>

Only a single option controlling the output mode may be specified. An
output or input file different from the default may be defined only
once in the command line. The other options may be specified in any
combination. If conflicting options are used, then the last one on the
command line determines the result.  
<p>
Note that in previous versions of MolScript (v1.4 and older) it was
possible to specify the output format by giving a keyword in the input
file. This is <a href="new.html#output">no longer possible</a>.

<h2><a name="environment">Environment variables</a></h2>

The MolScript program can use one environment variable:
MOL3D_PDB_DIR. If this is set to the name of the directory where the
local copy of the PDB database distribution is located, it allows one
to use just the PDB code in place of the complete file name in the
<a href="coordinates.html#read">read</a> command. See this command for
more information.

<h2><a name="minimal">A minimal input file</a></h2>

amino-acid chain for the molecule in the coordinate set, after
centering all atoms.

   plot
     read mol "protein.pdb";      ! Read the coordinate file.
     transform atom *             ! Xform all atoms so that the centre-

     trace amino-acids;           ! Output a CA trace of the chain.

<h2><a name="tips">Some useful tips</a></h2>

The <a href="molauto.html">MolAuto</a> program is almost always the
best starting point for making a good image of a molecule. The input
file produced by the MolAuto program will contain commands to render
both the secondary structure and the ligands. However, there will be
no transformation to get a good view.
<p>
To prepare a good image of a molecule, the main problem is to find a
good view. It is usually not a good idea to work on details such
as label positions or colours unless at least an approximate view has
been found. With the <a href="output.html#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL
mode</a>, it is fairly easy to find a good view, which is output from
the program, and then incorporated into the input file by the user. 
<p>
If you do not have the OpenGL implementation available, you must adopt
an iterative method instead: Use a
<a href="links.html#PostScript">PostScript display program</a> such
as <strong>xpsview</strong> or <strong>ghostview</strong> to view the output
from the MolScript program. Then edit the input file with an ordinary
text file editor, changing the transformation by adding rotations
and/or translations. Note that any number of rotations or translations
may be used in the <a href="coordinates.html#transform">transform</a>
command. Re-run MolScript, and view the results. Continue until a good
view has been found. 
<p>
Jane Richardson has listed some general points on the design of
schematic images of proteins
(<a href="references.html#Richardson-1985">Richardson 1985</a>).
These guidelines are still perfectly valid, although they were
formulated for hand-drawn images. Look at her drawings for
inspiration and guidance (Richardson 
<a href="references.html#Richardson-1981">1981</a>,
<a href="references.html#Richardson-1985">1985</a>).
<p>
An important point to make is that 90 degree views of a structure, if
carefully selected, can be very instructive. In fact, such views can
often bring home the message better than stereo plots. With MolScript,
90 degree views are ridiculously easy to prepare.
<a href="#stereo">Stereo plots</a>, however, are trickier to make.
<p>
When displaying superpositions of structures (for instance, sets of
structures derived from NMR data), then the 
<a href="coordinates.html#store-matrix">store-matrix</a>
and <a href="coordinates.html#recall-matrix">recall-matrix</a>
commands must be used, rather than the ordinary ways of getting a good
view. The reason is that if the
<a href="values.html#vector">position</a> command is used, this will
give a slightly different transformation for different coordinate
sets, thus destroying the least-squares fit that (almost certainly)
has been done previously using some other program. In the display of
superimposed NMR structures, this will give plots where it looks as if
the structures superimpose better at the center of the plot than they
actually do. By using the command 
<a href="coordinates.html#store-matrix">store-matrix</a> after the
first coordinate set has been transformed, and then
<a href="coordinates.html#recall-matrix">recall-matrix</a> for the
other coordinate sets, you ensure that the original least-squares fit
is kept intact.

<li><a href="#disulfide">Disulfide bonds</a>
<li><a href="#per-residue">Per-residue colours</a>
<li><a href="#rainbow">Rainbow residue colours</a>
<li><a href="#close">Select residues close to a residue</a>
<li><a href="#stereo">Stereo plots</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="disulfide">Disulfide bonds</a></h3>
Why are not disulfide bonds output by default?
<p>
The reason is that the sulfur atoms in disulfide bonds typically
have a covalent bond distance of about 2.0-2.1 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m,
while the default value for the
<a href="state.html#bonddistance">bonddistance</a> parameter is only
1.9 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m. So in order to get a bond between two sulfur
atoms, this parameter has to be increased to, say,
2.5. <strong>Note</strong> that this may cause spurious bonds in other
parts of your structure, so reset the parameter back to its lower
value once the disulfide bonds have been created.

<pre>
   bonds in amino-acids;
   set bonddistance 2.5;
   bonds atom SG;
   set bonddistance 1.9;
</pre>

Why is the default value of the
<a href="state.html#bonddistance">bonddistance</a> parameter so low?
It is a compromise value intended to avoid problems of spurious bonds
in <i>e.g.</i>the five-membered rings of heme groups, while giving
reasonable results for other moieties.
<p>

<h3><a name="per-residue">Per-residue colours</a></h3>
Per-residue colours were introduced in MolScript v2.0. By switching on
the <a href="state.html#colourparts">colourparts</a> 
parameter, all schematic residue-based graphics objects
(for example
<a href="residue_commands.html#helix"><strong>helix</strong></a> and 
<a href="residue_commands.html#strand"><strong>strand</strong></a>) will
be coloured according to the current residue colours. These are all
white by default. They can be changed with the
<a href="state.html#residuecolour">residuecolour</a>
parameter.
<p>

<h3><a name="rainbow">Rainbow residue colours</a></h3>
You want to colour the schematic residue graphics objects from blue at
the N-terminus along the rainbow colours to red at the C-terminus.
<p>
Solution 1:
<code><blockquote>
set <a href="state.html#residuecolour">residuecolour</a>
<a href="selection.html#amino-acids">amino-acids</a>
<a href="values.html#ramp">rainbow</a>,
<a href="state.html#colourparts">colourparts</a> on;
<br>
helix from 1 to 10; <i>! or whatever</i>
</blockquote></code>
<p>
Solution 2:
<blockquote>
Use the <a href="molauto.html">MolAuto</a> program to create the
commands for the schematic residue graphics objects. By default, these
will be coloured in a rainbow fashion, but on an object-to-object
basis, not residue-by-residue.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="close">Select residues close to a residue</a></h3>
If you want to display all residues close to another residue, then use
the <a href="selection.html#close">close</a> selection
expression. However, since this expression takes an atom selection as 
argument, and produces an atom selection, the result must be converted
to a residue selection using the 
<a href="selection.html#contains">contains</a> expression.
<p>
As an example, to draw bonds for all atoms in all residues having an
atom within 5.0 &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m of a residue of type RTL, use the
following: 
<pre>
   bonds in contains close in type RTL 5.0;
</pre>
<p>

<h3><a name="stereo">Stereo plots</a></h3>
There is no specific command to make MolScript create stereo plots.
Instead, a stereo plot can be made by creating two similar plots in
two different output images, the only difference being a slight
rotation of all coordinates (about 4-6 degrees) in one of them.
<p>
Alternatively, in <a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript
output</a> it is possible to make two plots on the same paper
(position them with the <a href="header.html#area">area</a> command)
and draw the  same objects in both, adding a small rotation to one of
them. 
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="problems">Common problems</a></h2>

<h3><strong>&quot;Error: parse error&quot;</strong></h3>

You may have forgotten the semi-colon ';' that must be present to
finish the previous command, or you may have used an invalid or
misspelled command, or you are trying to use a keyword or reserved
word as an identifier without using quotation marks. Check the input
file at or before the line and item indicated by the error message.
<p>

<h3>Weird helices or strands</h3>

If you use a too generous definition of helices and strand, then most 
likely there will be strange effects at the terminii. To reduce or
remove the problem, just shorten the secondary structure elements by
one or two residues. The secondary structure determined by the
<strong>-ss_hb</strong> command-line option in the
<a href="molauto.html">MolAuto</a> program is usually good, while the
command-line option <strong>-ss_ca</strong> may occasionally be too
generous.
<p>
The algorithm for helix graphical object generation assumes reasonably
good  alpha-helical geometry, but can usually handle deviations like
proline bends gracefully. Of course, it cannot take care of all kinds
of irregularities.
<p>
Sometimes, a beta-strand may flip over on its back. This is most often
due to prolines or cross-over in the strand, and is difficult to do
anything about. Sometimes it may be best to split the strand up to
handle the problem.
<p>

<h3>Difficulty to position label strings</h3>

Since parameters such as
<a href="state.html#labelcentre">labelcentre</a> and
<a href="state.html#labeloffset">labeloffset</a> are part of the
graphics state, and hence persistent, it is a common mistake to set an
offset for a particular label, but forgetting that all labels after 
that in the input file will also be affected. Just change these 
parameters appropriately.
<p>

<h3>Coils/turns not connected to helices/strands</h3>

This is most likely due to not giving the proper residue selection for
the relevant commands. If residues 1-4 and 7-10 are strands, then the
turn in between should be given as <nobr><code>&quot;from 4 to
7&quot;</code></nobr>, <strong>not</strong> <nobr><code>&quot;from 5
to 6&quot;</code></nobr>. The graphical objects begin and end at the
given residues. 
<p>

<h3>Coil radius is not depth-cued</h3>

In the <a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript output mode</a>,
the coil radius is depthcued only when
<a href="header.html#slab">slab</a> is set explicitly in the input file.
