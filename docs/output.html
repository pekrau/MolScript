In the first version of MolScript there was only the 
<a href="#PostScript">PostScript</a> output format. With the
introduction of several other output formats, first with
<a href="#Raster3D">Raster3D</a> in v1.4, and now with
<a href="#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> and  
<a href="#OpenGL">OpenGL</a> (and the <a href="#image">image file</a>
formats based on OpenGL), there is now an issue of how to make output
in different modes as similar as possible when the same input file is used.
<p>
The goal is obviously to make the output as similar as possible in
different output modes. However, completely identical output is
difficult to obtain. There are cases when the implementation of a
particular command or state parameter is too difficult or would be
very inefficient for a particular output format.
<p>
Sometimes a particular output format has special features which are
quite useful. These features may be used by MolScript, even if there
is no counterpart in the other output formats. One such example is the
<a href="commands.html#anchor">anchor</a> command which is meaningful
only in the <a href="#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> output format. 
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="PostScript">PostScript file</a></h2>

The PostScript output mode was the original output mode for
MolScript. Much effort has gone into keeping the output for PostScript
mode identical in appearance (but not necessarily in implementation)
for this version compared with the previous versions.
<p>
The hidden-surface algorithm in the PostScript mode relies on the
graphical segments being sufficiently small. The introduction of some
new commands, <i>e.g.</i>
<a href="residue_commands.html#cylinder">cylinder</a> and 
<a href="commands.html#object">object</a>, have necessitated the
addition of the <a href="state.html#segmentsize">segmentsize</a>
parameter which controls the subdivision of certain graphical
segments. Another addition is the
<a href="state.html#labelbackground">labelbackground</a> parameter
which is useful for labels in cluttered regions of the image.
<p>
Transparency and explicit light sources have not been implemented for
PostScript in the current version of MolScript.
<p>
In previous versions of MolScript (v1.4 and older), the Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) format was exactly identical to the PostScript
output, apart from a few lines of output code. However, this caused
considerable confusion, since much software (desktop publishing and
other office applications) apparently seems to assume the existence of
a pixmap in an EPS file. In this version of MolScript, the
<a href="#EPS">EPS implementation</a> is completely new and has now
been decoupled from the PostScript implementation. This is a major
departure from the <a href="new.html#policy">policy of backwards
compatibility</a>, but since the EPS format in v1.4 (and older) was
such a fiasco something had to be done.
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Raster3D">Raster3D input file</a></h2>

MolScript can generate an input file for the
<a href="links.html#Raster3D">Raster3D</a> package written by Ethan
A. Merritt and others. The Raster3D package is a freely available
ray-tracing program optimized for 3D molecular models. If you publish
images made with MolScript and Raster3D, be sure to cite
<strong>both</strong> programs
(<a href="references.html#Merritt-1994">Merritt &amp; Murphy, 1994</a>).
<p>
MolScript produces an input file for the <strong>render</strong>
program, which produces an image file in either SGI (aka RGB) format,
or TIFF format, depending on how you compiled the Raster3D 
package. <strong>Version 2.4b (or later) of Raster3D is required for
use with MolScript v2.1</strong>. It is now also possible to compile a
version of <strong>render</strong> which produces JPEG image files
directly. 
<p>
It is now possible to output labels to the Raster3D file, provided
that you have compiled MolScript with the
<a href="links.html#GLUT">GLUT library</a>. 
<p>
MolScript now allows a larger degree of control over the values
written to the header section of the Raster3D input file, mainly
through the <a href="use.html#options">command-line options</a>. This 
includes the size of the image (in pixels), the aliasing scheme 
and the background colour.
<p>
However, it is still possible to use a manually edited header section,
by having a file called <strong>header.r3d</strong> present in the
directory where MolScript is executed. The content of this file must
be valid for the <strong>render</strong> program of Raster3D;
MolScript does not check the contents. If the file is present,
MolScript will use it instead of generating the header itself.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> The header file feature was kept just for
backwards compatibility, and may be removed in future versions. It is
badly designed.
<p>
The control of the light source features is incomplete for the
Raster3D format. This is largely due to the differences in the
Raster3D lighting model compared to some other systems.
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> There may be changes in the implementation
of the lighting parameters for the Raster3D output mode in future
versions of MolScript. 
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="VRML">VRML 2.0 file</a></h2>

VRML 2.0 (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is a file format for 
specifying 3D objects with geometry, appearance, Web links and
behaviours. The files are intended for transmission over the Internet
in a fashion similar to HTML files. VRML 2.0 is specified in an
<a href="links.html#VRML">international standard</a> (where it has 
been officially renamed &quot;VRML 97&quot;) and is described in 
<a href="references.html#Hartman-1996">Hartman &amp; Wernecke 
1996</a> and <a href="references.html#Carey-1997">Carey &amp; Bell 
1997</a>. A VRML file (or world) is viewed in a browser, which most
often is a so-called plug-in for an ordinary Web browser (such as
Netscape or Microsoft's Internet Explorer), and which can usually be
obtained from some <a href="links.html#VRML">web site</a>.
The ability to use Web links and behaviours in VRML opens the avenue
for creating content-rich and informative 3D models of molecules,
especially such complex entities as proteins.
<p>
The current version of MolScript contains support for the output of
all graphical objects and also Web links
(<a href="commands.html#anchor">anchors</a>). Experimental
implementations of features to support dynamical behaviour in VRML
have been made, and some are actually present in the current
version. However, since these features are just experimental it is
highly likely that they will change in design and implementation, and
it was therefore decided to let these features remain undocumented, so
as to avoid future confusion in the user community.
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="OpenGL">Interactive OpenGL</a></h2>

The <a href="links.html#OpenGL">OpenGL graphics</a> mode
allows interactive rotation and scaling of the displayed objects, and
has features that simplify the creation and fine-tuning of complex
input files. The graphical objects created in this implementation
utilise the features in the
<a href="links.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</a> API
(<a href="references.html#Neider-1993">Neider <i>et al</i> 1993</a>)
for high-quality rendering. 
<p>
The <a href="links.html#GLUT">GLUT library</a> is used for the
interaction between OpenGL and the computer windowing system. The
copyright notice for the GLUT library is
<a href="copyright.html#GLUT">given here</a>. 
<p>
The number of bits used for the various image buffers is output as a
diagnostic message. These values are the maximum available on the
system that is used.
<p>
The mouse buttons have different functions
depending on whether the Shift key is pressed down when the mouse
button is clicked:
<p>

<table border cellpadding=5>

<tr>
<th>

<p>
The menu choices available through the right mouse button are
activated by holding down the button, moving the mouse over the menu
option so that it becomes highlighted, and then releasing the

action depends on the window system of your computer. The menu option
is changed to &quot;Normal window&quot; (see below). 
</td>

<a href="header.html#slab">slab</a> parameters, and the transformation
matrix to be used in a
<a href="coordinates.html#transform">transform</a> command applied to
all atoms to give the current view of the molecule. This feature
allows the user to find a good view in an interactive fashion. The
output text can be cut-and-pasted into the input file.

<h2><a name="image">Image files (based on OpenGL)</a></h2>

The image file output mode depends entirely on the
<a href="#OpenGL">OpenGL implementation</a>. If your computer system
does not allow an <a href="installation.html">installation</a> using
the OpenGL implementation, then none of the image file output formats
will be available. Also, the current version relies on the X window
system extension GLX for OpenGL, which implies that a UNIX system is
required. 
<p>
The image is created via the OpenGL rendering system in exactly the
same way as the <a href="#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL</a> mode, 
except that the image is rendered to a pixmap in memory instead of a
window on the display. The pixmap is read off and written to a
file having the requested format. The rendering is exactly identical
for all image file formats.  
<p>
The number of bits used for the various image buffers is output as a
diagnostic message. These values are the maximum available on the
system, and may differ from those used by the
<a href="#OpenGL">interactive OpenGL</a> mode.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that if the image file format includes
compression of some kind (JPEG, GIF, optionally PNG), it no longer is
identical to the OpenGL image, just a resonable approximation of it.
<p>

<h3><a name="SGI">SGI (aka RGB)</a></h3>

The SGI image file format, also know as RGB format, is a loss-less
run-length-encoded format for 2D images. It is very well suited for
MolScript images.
<p>
The SGI image format is in principle specific to SGI IRIX machines, 
but it is used in some software on other systems as well.
<p>
The implementation in MolScript relies on no third-party software,
only on a package that is part of the MolScript distribution. This
package is based on the
<a href="links.html#SGI">published specification of the SGI image file
format</a>.
<p>

<h3><a name="EPS">Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)</a></h3>

The Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format in MolScript v2.0 is a pixmap
encoding of the image rendered by the OpenGL implementation. It can be
included in PostScript documents by many kinds of office and
desktop-publishing software.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that this EPS implementation is quite different
from that in the previous versions of MolScript (v1.4 and older). This
is a proper pixmap encoding, while the previous versions were
basically just ordinary PostScript files with a few small differences.
<p>

<h3><a name="JPEG">JPEG</a></h3>

The JPEG format is a compressed, lossy image file format in widespread
use on the Web. It is a generally accepted, machine-independent
standard. 
<p>
Unfortunately, JPEG was designed mainly with real-world pictures in
mind, so the compression algorithm used is not optimal for the images
rendered by MolScript. The main problem arises for large surfaces with
homogenous colours. These may look blotchy, particularly if a low
quality parameter is used.
<p>
The implementation relies on the publicly available 
<a href="links.html#JPEG">JPEG library</a>. The copyright notice for
the JPEG library is <a href="copyright.html#JPEG">given here</a>. 
<p>

<h3><a name="PNG">PNG</a></h3>

The PNG format is a format that may be either compressed or not, and
the compression may be loss-less. It is very well suited for MolScript
images. 
<p>
The PNG image format is intended as a replacement for both the
patent-afflicted GIF format and the JPEG format. New Web browsers are
supposed to support PNG. The VRML 2.0 specification requires support
for PNG images. 
<p>
The implementation relies on the publicly available
<a href="links.html#PNG">PNG and zlib libraries</a>. The copyright
notice for the PNG library is <a href="copyright.html#PNG">given
here</a>, and for the zlib library <a href="copyright.html#zlib">here</a>.
<p>

<h3><a name="GIF">GIF</a></h3>

The GIF image file format is very common on the Web. It is a
compressed format using a colour map restricted to a maximum of only
256 entries, so it is not very well suited for MolScript images. The
current implementation in MolScript uses a so-called error diffusion
algorithm (<a href="references.html#Foley-1990">Foley <i>et al</i>,
1990</a>) to minimize the visual artifacts. 
<p>
The implementation relies on the publicly available
<a href="links.html#GIF">gd 1.3 library</a> for creation of the GIF
files. The copyright notice for the gd 1.3 library is 
<a href="copyright.html#gd 1.3">given here</a>.
<p>
The GIF format usually uses LZW compression, which is patented
by Unisys. This creates a legal problem for commercial software.
The current implementation uses version 1.3 of the gd library, which
does <strong>not</strong> use LZW compression, thus avoiding the
patent issue. Unfortunately, the run-length encoding it uses instead
is less efficient, so the GIF files produced by MolScript are much
bigger (by about a factor of 2.5) than they ought to be.
