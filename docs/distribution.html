<h1 align=center>Distribution</h1>

The MolScript program is distributed as source code (ANSI C) together
with Makefiles, documentation and example input files. You will have
to compile the program yourself.
<p>
See the
<a href="http://www.avatar.se/molscript/">MolScript Official Web
Site</a> for current information on how to obtain the program.
<p>
Although <a href="links.html#GNU">GNU's</a> <strong>bison</strong>
(GNU's equivalent of <strong>yacc</strong>) was used to develop the
program, it is not required to compile the program, since the C source
code files produced by <strong>bison</strong> from the 
<strong>molscript.y</strong> file are included in the distribution. 
<p>
MolScript will compile with just the code that is included in the
distribution. This gives the basic implementation which can output
<a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript</a>,
<a href="output.html#Raster3D">Raster3D</a> and 
<a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> files.
<p>
If your computer systems supports
<a href="links.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</a> rendering, then an
implementation allowing an interactive graphics window can be
compiled. This also requires the 
<a href="links.html#GLUT">GLUT library</a> by Mark Kilgard. The
OpenGL implementation allows several different image file output
formats to be produced. Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS) and SGI
(aka RGB) image files are supported without any additional
software. The <a href="links.html#JPEG">JPEG</a>,
<a href="links.html#PNG">PNG</a> and
<a href="links.html#GIF">GIF</a> image file formats require the 
corresponding libraries. None of these additional libraries are
included in the MolScript distribution. You must
<a href="links.html">fetch them</a> and install them yourself.
