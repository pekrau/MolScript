<h1 align=center>Interface to external objects</h1>

A new feature of MolScript v2 is the interface to external graphical
objects. This interface allows graphical objects created by other
programs to be included in images. For example, the graphical objects
may be a molecular surface generated by some external program, or it
may be a chicken-wire representation of an electron density map. 
<p>
The interface is based on a simple file format definition, which
may contain the graphical primitives points, lines and triangular
surfaces, in any combination.

</strong>.
<p>
Several parameters in the MolScript
<a href="state.html">graphics state</a> affect the appearance of the
external objects in the image. Some of the object primitives in the
file may contain specifications of colour and surface normals.
<p>
The external graphical object file is included in the image by the
<a href="commands.html#object">object</a> command, which reads the
file and outputs the specified objects to the image according the the
state parameters at that point in the input file. An important
parameter is the
<a href="state.html#objecttransform">objecttransform</a> parameter,
which determines whether or not the coordinates in the object file are
to be transformed by the most recently used transformation matrix.
