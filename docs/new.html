<h2><a name="new">New features in v2.1</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 contain no new features compared to v2.1;
they just fixed a few bugs.
<p>
<li>The <a href="output.html#GIF">GIF image file output mode</a>.
<li>Commands <a href="state.html#push-pop">push and pop</a>, to
save and restore state parameter values.
<li>Command <a href="commands.html#comment">comment</a>, to output
a comment to the output file.
<li>Command <a href="commands.html#debug">debug</a>, to issue a
run-time message.
<li><a href="coordinates.html#read">Read</a> command: a valid PDB data
set code as argument is interpreted as a file in a local copy of the
PDB data bank, if the environment variable MOL3D_PDB_DIR is set.
<li>Atom selection: <a href="selection.html#element">element</a>, to
select atoms of a chemical element type.
<li>Atom selection: <a href="selection.html#res-atom">res-atom</a>
which simplifies selecting a specific atom in a given residue. 
<li>Atom selection: <a href="selection.html#peptide">peptide</a>
to select atoms C, O and N in amino acid residues.
<li>Residue selection: <a href="selection.html#segid">segid</a>, to
select residues with a given segment identifier.
<li>The double-quote character '&quot;' may now be included in a
<a href="values.html#string">string</a> by escaping it with a
backslash character: '\&quot;'. MolAuto now also handles cases with
single double-quote characters in PDB COMPND records properly.
<li>Simplified distribution directory structure, making the
installation easier.

<h2><a name="backwards">Backwards compatibility issues</a></h2>

There are a few cases where v2.1 is incompatible with
previous versions, and where input files which work for v1.4 (and
older) are no longer valid.
<p>

<h3><a name="anchor-commands">Allowed commands within anchor
command</a></h3>
The <a href="commands.html#anchor">anchor</a> command now allows a
more restricted set of commands within the curly brackets, compared to
what was allowed in v2.0. This is due to a cleanup of the syntax
description, which was sloppy in v2.0. This should not present a
problem in most cases, since the commands that have been excluded were
unlikely to be used within the anchor command anyway.
<p>

<h3><a name="EPS">Completely different Encapsulate PostScript (EPS)
output</a></h3>
The EPS format of the previous versions (v1.4 and older) was
fundamentally problematic. It was nearly identical in form with the
proper PostScript output. Although formally valid according to the
<a href="references.html#Adobe-1990">PostScript Reference Manual</a>,
it apparently did not satisfy almost any available software.
<p>
The new <a href="output.html#EPS">EPS output mode</a> has therefore
been completely redesigned to produce a pixel-based image file format,
containing a pixmap of the image rendered via
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</a>.
<p>

<h3><a name="coordinates">Only PDB coordinate files supported</a></h3>

In the current version, only PDB coordinate files are
supported.
<p>
The reason for this was that no examples of the other input
file formats could be easily obtained for testing during the
reimplementation of MolScript.
<p>
The other coordinate file formats supported in the previous versions
(v1.4 and older) have become even less important since 1993, and the
PDB format (with all its limitations and problems) is the undisputed
<i>de facto</i> interchange standard for biomacromolecules. 

<p>
<h3><a name="colourdepthcue">Parameter colourdepthcue removed</a></h3>

The colourdepthcue parameter in the graphics state has been
removed. Its functionality has been replaced in version 2 by the 
<a href="header.html#fog">fog</a> header command.
<p>
The reasons for this change were partly that the function of the old
parameter was badly designed, partly that it was difficult to
implement it in output modes other than PostScript. 

<h3><a name="output">The output mode cannot be specified in the input file</a></h3>

In previous versions of MolScript (v1.4 and older) it was possible to
specify the output format produced by MolScript directly in the input
file, by giving a keyword <code>encapsulated</code> or
<code>raster3d</code> before the first plot. This possibility has been
removed. The output format must now be specified as a
<a href="use.html#options">command-line option</a>. 
<p>
The reason for removing this feature was that it was messy (both for
the user and for the developer of MolScript) to have two different
ways of specifying output format. Also, it was unclear how to resolve 
conflicts between an explicit setting in the input file and a given
command-line option.
<p>

<h3><a name="bondcross">Crosses will be drawn for non-bonded atoms</a></h3>
A new parameter <a href="state.html#bondcross">bondcross</a> was
introduced in version 2, which controls the size of crosses drawn for
non-bonded atoms in the <a href="atom_commands.html#bonds">bonds</a>
command. The same behaviour as in previous versions of MolScript (v1.4
and older) can be obtained by setting the value of this parameter to 0.0.

<h2><a name="policy">Version development policy</a></h2>

The development of MolScript progresses at a very uneven speed. New
versions containing novel features and/or bug fixes are planned, but
the implementation of these take place whenever there is time. No
commitment as to release dates can be given. 
<p>
However, the author gives the following statement of intent:

<blockquote>
No new features will conflict with previously available
features. Later versions of MolScript will be proper supersets of 
earlier versions, <i>i.e.</i> everything that works with one version
of MolScript will work with a later version.
<p>
Erroneous behaviour (<i>i.e.</i> bugs) may be changed between
versions. In v2.1, this applies especially to the implementation of
lighting in the 
<a href="output.html#Raster3D">Raster3D output mode</a>, which 
is <a href="bugs.html#Raster3D">suboptimal</a>, and should be improved
in future versions.
<p>
Only in extremely well-founded cases will there be exceptions to this 
(<a href="#backwards">but see below</a>). However, if any such
exceptions are introduced, these will be high-lighted in the
documentation. 
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason for giving this statement is to make it possible for other
programmers to produce software that automatically generates MolScript
input files, which will be valid also for later versions of MolScript.
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that this policy statement does
<strong>not</strong> refer to the internal implementation details of
MolScript, nor to the details of the output file formats. For
instance, the procedure definitions in the
<a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript</a> output file, or the
PROTO's in the <a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> output file may
very well change from one version to the next. 
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="not-API">Not an API!</a></h2>

The MolScript software is <strong>not</strong> an API (Application
Programming Interface). The internal features of the MolScript source
code are not intended to be used as library routines in other
software. 
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that there is no guarantee that the organisation
of the source code will be stable in future versions of MolScript. The
source code may change drastically between releases. Any modifications
or addition you make to the source code will most likely have to be
reviewed carefully before upgrading to a new version.
