LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.  It
is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

WARNING: Unisys has begun to enforce their patent on LZW compression against
GIF encoders and decoders.  You will need a license from Unisys to use the
included rdgif.c or wrgif.c files in a commercial or shareware application.
At this time, Unisys is not enforcing their patent against freeware, so
distribution of this package remains legal.  However, we intend to remove
GIF support from the IJG package as soon as a suitable replacement format
becomes reasonably popular.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

      have to modify the includes below to get it to work on your
      system, and you may have to supply the correct compiler flags in

      operating system/compiler combination.  Read libpng.txt for more
      information, including how to contact the authors if you have any
      problems, or if you want your compiler/platform to be supported in
      the next official libpng release.

END OF COPYRIGHT STATEMENT

   Version 1.3 features the following changes:
   
   Non-LZW-based GIF compression code
          Version 1.3 contains GIF compression code that uses simple Run
          Length Encoding instead of LZW compression, while still
          retaining compatibility with normal LZW-based GIF decoders
          (your browser will still like your GIFs). LZW compression is
          patented by Unisys. This is why there have been no new versions
          of gd for a long time. THANKS to Hutchison Avenue Software
          Corporation for contributing this code. THE NEW CODE PRODUCES
          LARGER GIFS AND IS NOT WELL SUITED TO PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES. THIS
          IS A LEGAL ISSUE. IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF TECHNICAL SKILL.
          PLEASE DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SIZE OF GIF OUTPUT. THANKS!
