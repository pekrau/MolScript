<h1 align=center>Lighting and appearance</h1>

Explicit lighting is a new feature in v2 of MolScript. This is a
short overview of the parameters that affect lighting. Some other
topics involving the appearance of graphics objects are also
discussed.

<h2><a name="lighting">Lighting</a></h2>

The lighting features in MolScript have been designed such that the
default values should give a reasonable appearance for all graphics
objects, similar to the image produced by previous versions (v1.4 and
older) of MolScript. 
<p>
The light sources in MolScript are global: A light source created at
some point in the input file will illuminate objects which have been
created in the same file, no matter where.
<p>
There is often a limit to the number of light sources that can
be defined in a scene, depending on which output format is used, and
which computer system is used to view the resulting scene. For the
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">OpenGL output mode</a> there is a maximum
of 8 light sources (including the headlight).
<p>
It should be noted that the lighting features apply to graphics
objects with surfaces, not to those consisting only of lines, labels
or points.

<h3><a name="sources">Light sources</a></h3>

There are three different kinds of light sources:
<ul>
<li><a href="commands.html#directionallight">directionallight</a>
<li><a href="commands.html#pointlight">pointlight</a>
<li><a href="commands.html#spotlight">spotlight</a>
</ul>
Some graphics parameters affect all of these, while others affect only
one kind of light source. See the descriptions for each kind of light
source. 
<p>
The interplay between the different light source parameters and the
surface properties are quite complex, and is not be described
here. See the descriptions in the OpenGL Programming Guide
(<a href="references.html#Neider-1993">Neider <i>et al</i> 1993</a>) or
the Annotated VRML 2.0 Reference Manual
(<a href="references.html#Carey-1997">Carey &amp; Bell 1997</a>) for
exhaustive descriptions. 

<h3><a name="headlight">Headlight</a></h3>

A default light called the headlight is defined and switched on, by
default. This is a white, directional light source, conceptually
located at the position of the viewer, and shining towards the
origin. In the current version of MolScript, its properties cannot be
changed in any way except being
<a href="header.html#headlight">switched on and off</a>.  

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="material">Material properties</a></h2>

<h3><a name="diffuse">Diffuse colour</a></h3>

The inherent colour of a surface is usually equated with the diffuse
colour used in lighting calculations.
<p>
In MolScript, the diffuse colour is taken from different parameters
depending on whether the
<a href="state.html#colourparts">colourparts</a> parameter is switched
on or off.
<p>
If <a href="state.html#colourparts">colourparts</a> is
<strong>off</strong> (the default), then the diffuse colour is
determined by the <a href="state.html#planecolour">planecolour</a>, 
the <a href="state.html#plane2colour">plane2colour</a> and
<a href="state.html#atomcolour">atomcolour</a> parameters (depending
on the graphics object).
<p>
If <a href="state.html#colourparts">colourparts</a> is switched
<strong>on</strong>, then the diffuse colour is determined by the
<a href="state.html#residuecolour">residuecolour</a> or 
<a href="state.html#atomcolour">atomcolour</a> parameters (depending
on the graphics object).

<h3><a name="specular">Specular colour</a></h3>

The specular colour is the surface property that modulates the colour
of light that has conceptually been directly reflected (as in a
mirror) by the surface. This is used to model shiny surfaces, such as
metals.
<p>
The <a href="state.html#specularcolour">specularcolour</a>
determines the specular reflection of a surface regardless of
its diffuse colour. It is set to <strong>black</strong> (that is, no
specular colour) by default. 

<h3><a name="emissive">Emissive colour</a></h3>

The emissive colour is a colour which is independent of any light
sources in the scene. It is used to model glowing objects, or objects
whose colour should be independent of any light sources in the
scene.
<p>
The <a href="state.html#emissivecolour">emissivecolour</a>
parameter determines the emissive colour of a surface regardless
of its diffuse colour. It is set to <strong>black</strong> (that is,
no emissive colour) by default. 
<p>
<strong>Note</strong> that using an emissive colour for an object does
not turn it into a light source illuminating other objects in the
scene. If you want an atom or another object to actually behave as a 
light source, then you must create a light source at that position.

<h3><a name="transparency">Transparency</a></h3>

Transparent surfaces allow objects which are hidden behind the
transparent object to be at least partly visible. This effect can be
very useful in many cases. It should be noted that a true transparency
calculation is usually rather demanding, so some output formats
(<a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> and
<a href="output.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</a>) rely on approximations which
may or may not be adequate.
<p>
The <a href="state.html#transparency">transparency</a> parameter
affects all graphics objects, including lines, labels and points. The
value is by default set to 0.0, which means no transparency.
<p>
It has been noted that the <a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a>
files display incorrectly in some browsers when partial transparency
has been applied. A surface specified with transparency 0.9 is almost
completely opaque, when it should be very nearly translucent. This
seems to be a bug in some commonly used browsers, and is, as far as is
possible to ascertain, not due to MolScript. A value of 0.5 seems to
give correct results.

<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation differences</a></h2>

The implementation of lighting in MolScript v2.1 is unfortunately
neither complete nor identical in all output formats. The PostScript
and Raster3D output modes are the most defective. 
<p>
The implementations for 
the <a href="output.html#OpenGL">OpenGL output</a> and
<a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0 output</a> modes are very similar
and should be correct.

<h3><a name="PostScript">PostScript</a></h3>

The <a href="output.html#PostScript">PostScript output mode</a> has
the largest differences from the ideal, which in part relates to its
inherent limitations, and in part to the difficulty of implementation
of some of the appearance effects that are easy to produce in the
other output modes.
<p>
The PostScript output mode has no implementation of light sources or
material surface properties. The closest it comes to lighting are the
<a href="state.html#shading">shading</a> and
<a href="state.html#shadingexponent">shadingexponent</a> parameters
which determine the shading of surfaces as a function of the angle
between the surface normal and the view direction. This is in effect a
simple calculation of the effects of a headlight.
<p>
Another important difference exists compared to the other modes: In
PostScript, all graphical objects are delimited by lines drawn around 
the surfaces. This is very important to create the proper visual
effects for the various graphics objects in this output mode. Therefore
all graphics state parameters that affect lines
(<a href="state.html#linecolour">linecolour</a>,
<a href="state.html#linedash">linedash</a> and
<a href="state.html#linewidth">linewidth</a>) also affect the
appearance of most other graphical objects. This is not the case for
the other output formats.
<p>
A related difference is the <a href="state.html#depthcue">depthcue</a>
parameter, which affects many different objects in the PostScript
output mode. It does not affect any other output modes. The basic idea
is that the distance from the object to the viewer affects various
appearance details, such as the size of labels or the width of lines.
<p>

<h3><a name="Raster3D">Raster3D</a></h3>

The implementation of lighting in the
<a href="output.html#Raster3D">Raster3D output mode</a> is very
limited and partly incorrect. This is to a large extent due to the
inherent limitations in the Rasted3D file format.
