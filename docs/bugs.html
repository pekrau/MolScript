<h2><a name="caveat">Caveat for version 2.1</a></h2>

There may still be bugs in MolScript v2.1. Although the software is
used by many people, not all problems may have been reported to
me. Also, some new features and code modifications have been made
since v2.0.2, so new bugs may have crept in. Hopefully, they are not
too serious; many tests have been made during the development. Since
MolScript has been <a href="about.html#implementation">reimplemented
in the C programming language</a>, it is possible (even likely) that
entirely new bugs, which did not exist in the previous versions, have
been introduced.
<p>
If you have found a bug, then please <a href="#reporting">report it</a>.

<h2><a name="known">Known bugs</a></h2>

<h3><a name="general">General bugs</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
Only the <a href="links.html#protein">PDB coordinate file format</a>
is supported in the <a href="new.html#coordinates">current version</a>.
<p>
<p>
<li>
The graphics commands <a href="atom_commands.html#bonds">bonds</a> and
<a href="atom_commands.html#ball-and-stick">ball-and-stick</a> are
inefficient in execution time, especially when two atom selections
are given and the first selection contains many atoms. For best
performance, put the selection with fewest atoms as the first one.
<p>
<li>
The <a href="values.html#rainbow">rainbow</a> colour ramp specification
switches automatically the
<a href="state.html#colourramp">colourramp</a> parameter to
<strong>hsb</strong> and the
<a href="state.html#hsbreverseramp">hsbreverseramp</a> parameter to
<strong>on</strong>. This is not reasonable behaviour.
<p>
<li>
The graphics state commands <a href="state.html#push-pop">push and
pop</a> do not save and restore the
<a href="state.html#atomcolour">atomcolour</a>,
<a href="state.html#atomradius">atomradius</a> and
<a href="state.html#residuecolour">residuecolour</a> parameters.
<p>
<li>
The <a href="commands.html#level-of-detail">level-of-detail</a>
command is not handled correctly in non-VRML output modes. Currently,
all alternative representations are rendered. The most detailed
representation should be used. 
</ol>

<h3><a name="PostScript">PostScript bugs</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
The <a href="header.html#slab">slab</a> command has not been
implemented properly.
<p>
<li>
The lighting parameters and commands are hardly implemented at all in
the <a href="lighting.html#PostScript">PostScript output
mode</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="lighting.html#transparency">Transparency</a> has not been
implemented. 
<p>
<li>
The <a href="residue_commands.html#strand">strand</a>s sometimes show
defects at twist points, and when viewed directly from the ends. If
this is a real problem in your case, then either increase the
<a href="state.html#segments">segment number</a> (for example from 6
to 10) for that strand, or rotate the atoms slightly around the x or y
axis. This should at least reduce the problem, if not remove it
completely. 
<p>
<li>
In general, the simple hidden-surface removal algorithm relies on
segments being small, and not overlapping severely. If unreasonable 
values for, say, the <a href="state.html#helixwidth">helixwidth</a> or
<a href="state.html#atomradius">atomradius</a> parameters are used,
then the  algorithm breaks down, and very strange results are
obtained. The parameter
<a href="state.html#segmentsize">segmentsize</a> can be used to reduce
or eliminate the problem in a few cases.
<p>
<li>
Lines at the edges of strands can sometimes appear jagged, especially
when a thick <a href="state.html#linewidth">linewidth</a> is used, and
when close to strand twist points. This bug is due to the simple
hidden-surface removal algorithm in the PostScript output mode, and
there is no simple way to eliminate this effect. 
<p>
<li>
In the <a href="atom_commands.html#cpk">cpk</a> atom representation,
the spheres do not overlap properly.  They are simply created as flat
disks and then depth-sorted.
<p>
<li>
When using a mixture of representations, such as
<a href="residue_commands.html#helix">helix</a> and 
<a href="atom_commands.html#ball-and-stick">ball-and-stick</a>, some
graphical segments are occasionally clipped incorrectly. This is due
to the simple hidden-surface removal algorithm. In a few cases, this
can be remedied by changing the orientation slightly.
</ol>

<h3><a name="Raster3D">Raster3D bugs</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
The <a href="header.html#slab">slab</a> command has not been
implemented properly.
<p>
<li>
The implementation of
<a href="commands.html#label">labels</a> in the Raster3D output mode
relies on a file from the
<a href="links.html#GLUT">GLUT library</a>, and may not therefore be
available, or may change in future GLUT versions. A more solid
solution should be implemented. No Greek characters can be output in
the Raster3D mode. 
<p>
<li>
The <a href="state.html#labelclip">labelclip</a> parameter has no effect.
<p>
<li>
The lighting parameters and commands are not well implemented.
<p>
<li>
The <a href="header.html#headlight">headlight</a> command does not
give the expected result. The secondary light source is switched off,
not the first. This is related to limitations in the
<a href="links.html#Raster3D">Raster3D</a> input file format. 
</ol>
<p>

<h3><a name="VRML">VRML 2.0 bugs</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
The implementation of
<a href="commands.html#label">labels</a> is incomplete: no Greek
characters can be output, and
<a href="state.html#labelcentre">label centering</a> has not been
implemented. 
<p>
<li>
The <a href="state.html#labelclip">labelclip</a> parameter has no effect.
</ol>
<p>

<h3><a name="OpenGL">OpenGL bugs</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
It is currently not possible to do translations of the objects to
obtain a better view in the interactive window. This is silly.
<p>
<li>
The input file re-read feature in the interactive menu is supposed
to work reasonably even if there are serious errors in the input
file. However, there are still pathological cases when MolScript will
crash completely when some types of input file errors are encountered.
<p>
<li>
The implementation of transparency relies on an approximation which is
probably needed for interactive performance. In some cases, this will
give rise to incorrect rendering.
<p>
<li>
The implementation of labels is incomplete: there are no Greek
characters, the parameters
<a href="state.html#labelcentre">labelcentre</a> and
<a href="state.html#labelclip">labelclip</a> have not been
implemented, and the 
<a href="state.html#labelsize">labelsize</a> parameter is implemented
as just a few different sizes. Transparency for labels has not been
implemented. 
<p>
<li>
The implementation of the
<a href="commands.html#object">object</a> command is in some parts
inefficient in rendering time, although probably not noticeable in
most cases. 
<p>
<li>
The <a href="residue_commands.html#coil">coil</a> and
<a href="residue_commands.html#turn">turn</a> graphical objects have a
quadratic cross-section. Although the surface normals help give an
illusion that the coil is a cylindrical object, this ought to be
improved.

<h2><a name="reporting">Reporting bugs that you have discovered</a></h2>

If you discover bugs which have not been documented previously
(<a href="#known">see above</a>), then please report them by email to
the author of MolScript: Per Kraulis
(<a href="mailto:pjk@avatar.se">pjk@avatar.se</a>).
<p>
In order to be able to identify the exact programming problem giving
rise to the observed bug, it is almost always necessary to have the
original input file and coordinate file: <strong>Please send the input
file and coordinate file along with the bug
description</strong>. Sending just a description of the problem is
usually not enough.
<p>
The author does <strong>not</strong> promise to be able to solve the
bug within any finite period of time. However, he will do his best,
since this is obviously in his own best interest.
<p>
It may happen that the coordinate file in question is not public (for
various reasons). Therefore, the author of MolScript makes the
following statement: 
<blockquote>
I, Per Kraulis, promise not to use any coordinate file sent to me for
debugging purposes for any other purpose than sorting out the
MolScript bug. The coordinate file will be destroyed once this has
been done, and no copy of it will be saved.
</blockquote>
