<h2><a name="reference">Publication reference</a></h2>

The MolScript program is described in the following publication:
<blockquote>
<strong>
Per J. Kraulis
</strong>
<br>
MOLSCRIPT: A Program to Produce Both Detailed and
Schematic Plots of Protein Structures.
<br>
<strong>
Journal of Applied Crystallography (1991) vol 24, pp 946-950.

<h2><a name="year2000">Year 2000 compliance</a></h2>

The current versions of the MolScript and MolAuto programs do not deal
in any way with date or time values. No calls to system features
involving date or time are made. The programs are therefore inherently
&quot;Year 2000 compliant&quot;.

<h2><a name="features">Notes on some features</a></h2>

<h3>Hermite splines</h3>
The spline function used to create segment coordinates for various
objects (coil, turn, strand, helix) is the Hermite spline
(<a href="references.html#Foley-1990">Foley <i>et al</i> 1990</a>).
This is based on two control points, which the curve passes through,
and directional vectors at these points. The advantage of this spline
is that it passes through all its control points. However, it requires
direction vectors of defined lengths. In MolScript, such vectors are
computed in different ways depending on the graphical object. 

<h3>Irregular secondary structure</h3>
A feature of MolScript is that irregularities in helices and strands
are still visible to some degree in the schematic drawings. Especially
the helices manage to convey bends and other irregularities without
turning ugly. Since only CA-coordinates are used for creating the
schematic drawings, even poorly refined structures can give
reasonable-looking schematic objects. This may or may not be
advantage, depending on one's point of view...

<h3>Selection mechanism</h3>
The atom and residue selection mechanism was inspired by a similar
facility in the structure refinement program X-PLOR
(<a href="references.html#Brunger-1992">Br&uuml;nger 1992</a>).

<h3>Orthographic projection</h3>
An orthographic projection is used in all output modes except 
<a href="output.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> output mode. The projection
used in VRML cannot be specified by MolScript; it is entirely
dependent on the VRML browser used to display the VRML file.

<h2><a name="background">Background</a></h2>

The MolScript program was conceived in the tradition of molecular
graphics of 
<a href="references.html#Richardson-1981">Jane Richardson</a>,
<a href="references.html#Lesk-1982">Arthur Lesk & Karl Hardman</a>,
and <a href="references.html#Priestle-1988">John Priestle</a>. The aim
was a program that could produce nice schematic drawings of proteins
as well as detailed views of specific residues. The graphical objects
helix, strand and coil were designed to look as much like
<a href="references.html#Richardson-1985">Jane  Richardson's
drawings</a> as possible.
<p>
The success of the MolScript program (more than 2,000 academic
licenses, and more than 30 commercial licenses issued by October 1997)
shows that there was a great need for such a program. In the years
since MolScript was first released (1991), several other similar
programs have appeared, which either are designed solely for producing
high-quality images of biological macromolecules, or have such output
procedures as integral features. For MolScript to remain useful in
such competition, novel features and improvements in the software in
the light of experience had to be implemented.
<p>
The emergence of the
<a href="links.html#VRML">VRML 2.0</a> standard in 1996-1997 for 3D
Web applications was an inspiration for creating a new version of
MolScript, since it was obvious that the features in MolScript were
a very good basis for creating informative and useful VRML
representations of molecular structures. The Web has from its start
been employed by the molecular biologists and geneticists for sharing
data and knowledge, thereby helping to create the new field called
bioinformatics. There is a huge potential for the biological
structural sciences to use the Web for sharing not only the
structural data itself, but also structural knowledge. The VRML 2.0
standard is a good basis for this.
<p>
The appearance of the <a href="links.html#OpenGL">OpenGL</a> standard
library and API for high-quality 3D graphics applications in 1993 made
it possible to write an interactive-graphics implementation for
MolScript which potentially could run on a broad range of computer
systems. Also, the off-screen rendering capabilities of many OpenGL
implementations made it possible to produce image files directly
through MolScript. Since such image files are now a staple of the Web,
such a feature would clearly be quite useful.

<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

The internal program structure of the previous version of MolScript
(v1.4) did not make it easy to introduce new output formats. When an
attempt was made to create a VRML 2.0 interface in a modified version
of  MolScript, it became clear that a redesign was necessary.
<p>
The previous versions of MolScript were written in Fortran 77. One
major problem with this was the lack of a standard dynamic-memory
feature in Fortran 77. This and other problems were reasons for
choosing another programming language.
<p>
Considering the various available programming languages, the final
decision was to use ANSI C: it is a small, simple language, with
almost universal and standardized support on all relevant computer
systems. For this application, this outweighs the drawbacks: no
object-oriented features, possible memory leaks using the primitive
memory allocation system, and the danger of name-space
collisions. Another consideration was the availability of many useful
software library packages and utilities in the C language or targeted
towards C, which could be useful. For example, the
<strong>bison</strong> utility from the  
<a href="links.html#GNU"> GNU project</a> and the
<a href="links.html#JPEG">JPEG library</a> from the Independent JPEG
Group. 
<p>
As part of the reimplementation, the routines that create the
graphical objects were clearly separated from the routines that output
the objects in a given format. This separation should facilitate
future implementation of novel output formats. Also, it makes it
easier to ensure that the appearance of the graphical objects is as
similar as possible in the different output formats.

<h2><a name="undocumented">Undocumented features</a></h2>

There may be some undocumented commands in the current version of
MolScript. These are highly experimental in nature. They may change
drastically, or be removed, in the next version. It is a waste of time
to try to figure out what they are and what they do.
